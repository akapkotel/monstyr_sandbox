# Monastyr RPG Sandbox Application

This is my special project written for me and my friends playing the Monastyr Role-Playing game campaign.
It is a pack of tools for players and GM, which makes easier to manage some aspects of game. It contains
two main elements:
1. Lords Manager Tool: simple tkinter window app which allows browsing through the local feudal hierarchy 
of noblemen.

2. Interactive Map application written with arcade library, which allows to explore game-area map. The Map
 is under construction.

Both applications use a common database, which is a simple shelve file. Code is written in Python 3.8 and
 library used is arcade 2.4.1.
